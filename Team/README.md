<h3>Overall:<h3>
   NSWRO is a team composed of three students from Nguyen Sieu High School who collaborate with Thay Phong Stem for the WRO 2025 season. We are the first team from Vietnam to compete in this category. Thus, there are many problems and difficulties, yet there are also many opportunities and experience we can gain from this event. 

<h3>Cao Tung Lam (on the right)<h3>
    Lam is the most experienced team member. He has competed in WRO for three seasons. He has won acclaim by finishing 8th in the Junior Robomission category in 2024. This year, looking to enrich and diversify his experience in robotics, he chose Future Engineer to bolster his knowledge with new engineering concepts and new programming experience. 

<h3>Do Cong Danh (on the left)<h3>
   This season is not Danh's first season, but it is his first season in such a high skill level environment. His contribution in this team is designing and assemblying the robot, assemblying the field. He also discovered many engineering principles which help our robot develop. 

<h3>Nguyen Uyen Nhu (in the middle)<h3>
    Just like Do, this is Nhu's first season in WRO. However, her rich experience with programming and GitHub helped her build this impressive repository. Furthermore, he aided Lam in the programming process, making the programmes more efficient and the algorithms to be more accurate.
